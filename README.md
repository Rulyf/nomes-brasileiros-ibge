This repo uses names already classified in F/M from: https://github.com/MedidaSP/nomes-brasileiros-ibge
That were extracted from [Names in Brazil â€“ IBGE](http://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/nomes/#/search).

So its possible to classify the gender of other Brazilian names from the IBGE Database using the IBGE Dataset from: https://basedosdados.org/dataset/703f9f0d-caee-4b47-b900-46b1dea2c33c?table=3bc00c7a-28e5-421b-b310-b32bed3dd4d4.
